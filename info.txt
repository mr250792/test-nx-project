 >  NX   Nx CLI is not installed globally.

   This means that you might have to use "yarn nx" or "npx nx" to execute commands in the workspace.
   Run "yarn global add nx" or "npm install -g nx" to be able to execute command directly.


 >  NX   Distributed caching via Nx Cloud has been enabled

   In addition to the caching, Nx Cloud provides config-free distributed execution,
   UI for viewing complex runs and GitHub integration. Learn more at https://nx.app
   
   Your workspace is currently unclaimed. Run details from unclaimed workspaces can be viewed on cloud.nx.app by anyone
   with the link. Claim your workspace at the following link to restrict access.
